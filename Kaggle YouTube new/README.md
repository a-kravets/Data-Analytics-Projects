# DESCRIPTION

We want to perform a brief discovery analysis of YouTube dataset and (1) check what relationships are between video category popularity and country,
(2) views/likes/dislikes ratios by category and country, and (3) what channels are watched in all the countries from the dataset.

# Datasource

The dataset is taken from [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/datasnaek/youtube-new).

It has 10 countries, where each country has two file types:

* `{country_short_name}.csv` which includes the video title, category_id, channel title, publish time, tags, views, likes and dislikes, description, and comment count.
* `{country_short_name}.json` which includes the category id (id), category name and channel name.
