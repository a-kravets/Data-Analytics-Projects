# Description

**Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)**

The goal was to calculate MRR using Python. Datasource contains two subscription plans: monthly and annual. To calculate overall/combined MRR,
we need to calculate MRR from monthly plan, MRR from annual plan (by distributing revenue over 12 months) and then sum these two numbers.

**Churn**

Churn is considered a client for Monthly plan that hasn't renewed his subscription by the end of the current month.
For Annual plan it is a client who hasn't renewed his plan during last 12 months.
